# M1 developer half: browser kit checkpoint

Work in progress under Source child `4735dfeed42d310099ea91521ed3998b74628c20`
and promise `8fb3e144c5ccd8dcc151d673ad89d57380a7bbca`, within M1
`eca1c7ee` / `7ff6cd96`. The developer half remains open. This checkpoint
is not a package format, install, complete kit or submitted Source.

The worktree includes reviewed A3 Main
`6dac9c76339ece16a99275d5360818a32a4dcf4c` and the M1 preparation note.
Planner decision `bba6c6b8` is still required before the persistent package,
URI/trust and install contracts are encoded. No answer is inferred here.

## Shared stored-key signer

The client exports `storedWebCryptoSigner` for an existing browser-held
Ed25519 key, including one restored through structured clone/IndexedDB.
Native CryptoKey metadata getters require a private, non-extractable,
sign-only Ed25519 key; ordinary objects or own-property shadows cannot
stand in for that native state. Each call owns the input bytes before its
await and verifies the resulting signature against the named public key.
The returned interface contains only the public key id and sign operation.
It imports, exports, stores, grants and sends nothing.

Counter keeps its application-specific origin, exact pin, membership,
member and binding validation. Its existing initial signing challenge
now uses the shared signer. Lending's generated/stored key uses the same
signer synchronously at its existing boundary. Neither app's storage
schema, key import flow, epoch, request state machine or scope authority
was moved or reinterpreted in this checkpoint. There is no new claim
about arbitrary package code, signing isolation or native enrollment.

Focused SDK/intent checks pass 11 cases (`d1f0d1`, exit 0), using genuine
Node WebCrypto. They cover restored non-extractable keys, original bytes
while caller data changes, signature domains, metadata forgery/shadowing
and mismatched public/private keys. Existing Counter key tests pass two
cases (`599d88`, exit 0), including buffer clearing, restored signatures,
legacy import and a swapped-key refusal. These are Node/key witnesses,
not browser persistence or rendered UI evidence.

The client test typecheck passes (`f9a49e`), and Counter/Lending browser
typechecks pass (`8e2fe1`, `bd9fcf`). Initial SDK test typechecks exposed
the Node generateKey union/overload; an explicit key-pair runtime narrowing
corrected the test factory. No production type assertion bypass was added.

Two one-line controls distinguish by assertion and restore their source:
extractability (`a734eb`, exit 0) and public binding (`0120db`, exit 0).
The first binding control (`91d070`, exit 2) was inconclusive because
Vitest classified the rejected-promise matcher failure as generic Error.
An explicit settled-outcome assertion corrected the witness; the same
fault then produced the intended assertion. The inconclusive result is
not passing evidence.

Dependencies use a private COW copy of the owned A3 view, with all 13
workspace links verified inside the canonical M1 tree and its lock stamp
checked. No package was installed. The first link-audit attempt confused
the `/tmp` alias with `/private/tmp`; canonical roots corrected that audit.

## Remaining developer work

Shared browser joining, storage and request custody; canonical package and
closure/signature checks; pack, new/dev/check; Counter/Lending package
conversion; and the matching browser evidence remain due. Generated
application asset modules have not been rebuilt for this source checkpoint;
the complete package conversion will replace their host composition.
No full gate has run for M1. It runs once at the completed submitted head,
followed by exact-head independent review. Nothing here is deployed,
published, installed into a room, or accepted as the M1 milestone.
